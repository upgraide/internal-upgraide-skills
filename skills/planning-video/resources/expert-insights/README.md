# Expert Insights

Distilled principles about video creation - collected from experience and external sources.

## Purpose

Capture insights that change how we approach video planning. Not general knowledge Claude already has - specific, actionable learnings.

## When to Save an Insight

Save an insight here when:
- ✅ It changed how we approach a problem
- ✅ It's specific enough to act on
- ✅ We've validated it works (not just theory)
- ✅ It's not obvious / Claude wouldn't know it

## When NOT to Save

Don't save if:
- ❌ It's general knowledge (e.g., "hooks are important")
- ❌ It's platform-specific and will become outdated
- ❌ We haven't tested it ourselves
- ❌ It's vague advice without actionable steps

## Format

Each insight should be concise and actionable:

```markdown
# [Insight Title]

**Source:** [Where we learned this - project, creator, experiment]
**Validated:** [How we know it works]

## The Insight

[1-3 sentences capturing the core idea]

## Why It Works

[Brief explanation of the underlying principle]

## How to Apply

[Specific, actionable steps]

## Example

[Concrete example from our work or the source]
```

## Categories

Organize insights by what they help with:

- **hooks/** - First 3 seconds, attention capture
- **retention/** - Keeping viewers watching
- **pacing/** - Rhythm, cuts, timing
- **structure/** - Overall video architecture
- **cta/** - Driving action at the end
- **audio/** - Sound design principles

## How Insights Get Added

1. **Post-production review:** What did we learn that surprised us?
2. **Inspiration analysis:** What pattern made this video work?
3. **External learning:** Creator tips we've validated ourselves
