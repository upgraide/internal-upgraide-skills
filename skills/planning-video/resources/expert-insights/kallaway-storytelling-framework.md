## The Insight

Six interconnected principles that transform scripts from "lists of events" into compelling stories that retain viewers. The core philosophy: retention is manufactured, not accidental.

## The 6 Principles

### 1. The Dance (Causality)

**Problem:** Amateur storytellers connect events with "and then" - creates flat, boring lists.

**Solution:** Replace "and then" with **"But"** or **"Therefore"**:
- "But" introduces complication (Conflict)
- "Therefore" introduces consequence (Resolution)

This forces causal chains: Action A causes Problem B, which forces Decision C.

### 2. Rhythm (Acoustics of Writing)

**Problem:** Same-length sentences create monotony - brain predicts pattern and tunes out.

**Solution:** Vary sentence length deliberately:
- Short sentences = impact, speed, tension
- Long sentences = flow, description, crescendo

**Test:** Look at your script's right margin. If it's a straight line, your rhythm is monotonous. You want a "jagged edge."

### 3. Tone (Psychology of Intimacy)

**Problem:** Viewers have a defense mechanism against "being presented to" - feels like being sold.

**Solution:** Dissolve the barrier so viewer feels "in the room" with you.
- Trick: Tape a photo of a close friend to the camera lens
- Shifts from "Public Speaking Mode" to "Intimate Mode"
- Intimacy creates trust, trust increases retention

### 4. Direction (Reverse Engineering)

**Problem:** Linear writing (starting at beginning) leads to weak endings.

**Solution:** Write the ending first ("The Last Dab"):
- Final line must be high-impact enough to trigger share reflex
- For short-form: ending should loop back to beginning seamlessly
- Like Christopher Nolan - complex narratives must be architected backward

### 5. Story Lenses (Differentiation via Refraction)

**Problem:** Reporting the same "light" (topic) as everyone else makes you a commodity.

**Solution:** Be the prism, not the light:
- Don't report on Taylor Swift at Super Bowl (everyone does)
- Report on the business economics of her attendance
- Find YOUR unique angle on common topics
- Dominate a "Category of One"

### 6. The Hook (Cognitive Speed)

**Problem:** Verbal hooks are weak because brain must imagine the subject.

**Solution:** Visual + Punchy + Indicative:
- Show while you tell (eyes process faster than ears)
- No mystery hooks ("You won't believe this")
- Tell viewer exactly what the utility is immediately

## How to Apply

When writing a script:

1. **Start with the ending** - What's the Last Dab?
2. **Work backward** - Plant the "buts" and "therefores" that lead there
3. **Find your prism** - What's YOUR unique angle?
4. **Write the hook** - Visual + specific + indicative
5. **Check rhythm** - Look for jagged edge
6. **Read aloud** - Does it sound intimate or preachy?

## Example Application

**Topic:** Claude can be a personal assistant
**Commodity angle:** "Here's how to use Claude" (everyone does this)
**Prism angle:** "Stop waiting for Apple to fix Siri - build your own assistant"

The prism transforms generic content into a unique perspective.
