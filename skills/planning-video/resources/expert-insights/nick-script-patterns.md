**Validated:** Patterns extracted from successful creator's content; consistent across multiple videos

## The Insight

Nick's videos follow a tight, repeatable formula optimized for short-form tech content. The scripts are 19-38 seconds, conversational, and action-oriented.

## Core Patterns

### Hook Formulas (Pick One)

| Formula | Example | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `"[Company] just [launched/dropped] [thing]"` | "Google just launched Pomelli" | News/announcement |
| `"Someone just [leaked/dropped] [thing]"` | "Someone just leaked the system prompts" | Discovery/reveal |
| `"This AI can [do X better than Y]"` | "This AI can create better presentations than Gamma" | Comparison |
| `"Stop [wasting X]"` | "Stop wasting your VEO3 credits" | Problem/solution |

### The "Just" Simplifier

Nick uses "just" constantly to make everything feel effortless:
- "You **just** paste in your website"
- "**Just** describe your topic"
- "**Just** pick a template"
- "**Just** comment [keyword]"

**Why it works:** Removes friction, makes complex things feel accessible.

### Instant Value Anchor

Immediately after hook, establish value:
- "and it's completely free"
- "collectively worth billions of dollars"
- "which companies usually charge thousands for"

### Feature Cascade

Rapid enumeration using "your":
- "your social media, your emails, your databases, your CRMs"
- "content, captions, visuals, and everything you need"
- "all on its own"

**Rhythm:** List of 3-5 items, rapid-fire delivery.

### Benefit Restatement (Before CTA)

Remind viewer of the value:
- "With this, you can save a ton of..."
- "Plus get professional looking..."
- "all on its own"

### CTA Formula (Identical Every Time)

```
"So if you want [it/them], just comment [keyword]
and I'll send you the link directly"
```

Variations:
- "Want to try it for yourself?"
- "So if you guys want to check them out..."
- "So go try it yourself"

## Script Template

```
[HOOK - Pick formula above]

[VALUE ANCHOR - "and it's completely free" or equivalent]

[FEATURE CASCADE - "your X, your Y, your Z"]

[HOW IT WORKS - "Just [step 1], [step 2], and that's it"]

[BENEFIT RESTATEMENT - "With this, you can..."]

[CTA - "Comment [keyword] and I'll send you the link"]
```

## How to Apply

1. **Choose hook formula** based on content type
2. **Add immediate value anchor** after hook
3. **Use "just" liberally** to simplify steps
4. **Cascade features** in groups of 3-5
5. **End with exact CTA formula** - don't reinvent
