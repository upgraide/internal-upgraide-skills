## Patterns to Learn

| Element | Pattern | Why It Works |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Hook** | [Number] + [Competitor] + "free and unlimited" | Triple value stack in one sentence |
| **"Free" placement** | At END of hook, not beginning | Creates surprise after impressive claim |
| **Structure** | 6 beats in 38s (~6s each) | Tight pacing, no filler |
| **Visual proof** | 5 different outputs in 5 seconds | Rapid variety proves capability |
| **Differentiator** | "something [X] can't do" | Creates category, positions against known tool |
| **CTA** | "Comment [keyword] and I'll send you the link" | Personal, creates engagement |
| **Urgency** | "48 hours" + "don't miss it" | Scarcity without being pushy |

## Visual Pattern (Hook: 0-5s)

| Second | Visual | Text |
|--------|--------|------|
| 0-1s | Boeing infographic | "This AI" |
| 1-2s | Different infographic | "10x better" |
| 2-3s | Different infographic | "than Gamma" |
| 3-4s | Different infographic | "and it's" |
| 4-5s | Different infographic | "free and unlimited" |

**Key insight:** 50/50 split screen (content top, avatar bottom), hard cuts every 1 second, static content (no animation within frames).

## How to Apply

1. **Hook formula:** "[Tool] does [impressive claim with number] - and it's [value anchor]"
2. **Put "free" at the END** of the hook, not the beginning
3. **Show rapid visual proof** in first 5 seconds (4-5 different outputs)
4. **Include competitor differentiation** - "something [known tool] can't do"
5. **End with exact CTA formula** - "Comment [X] and I'll send you the link"
6. **Target ~130 words / 38s** for this format
