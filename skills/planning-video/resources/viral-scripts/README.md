# Viral Scripts

Annotated examples of effective video scripts collected from successful projects.

## Purpose

Store script patterns that have proven to work - either from inspiration analysis or from our own successful videos.

## When to Save a Script

Save a script here when:
- ✅ Video performed well (high retention, engagement)
- ✅ Hook technique was particularly effective
- ✅ Structure can be applied to other topics
- ✅ It demonstrates a learnable pattern

## When NOT to Save

Don't save if:
- ❌ It's topic-specific without transferable patterns
- ❌ Performance was average or unknown
- ❌ It's just "good" - save only what's exceptional

## Format

Each script should include:

```markdown
# [Script Name]

**Source:** [Original video/creator or "Our project: archive/YYYY-MM-DD-name"]
**Performance:** [Metrics if available - views, retention, engagement]
**Duration:** [Length]
**Style:** [e.g., "Tech tutorial hook", "Product announcement"]

## How Scripts Get Added
