# Planning Video

Knowledge base for writing effective short-form video scripts.

## When to Use

- Writing a script from scratch
- Improving an existing script
- Analyzing what makes scripts work

## Quick Reference: Nick's Formula

```
[HOOK] - "X just dropped Y" or "Stop using X for Y"
[VALUE] - "and it's completely free"
[FEATURES] - "your X, your Y, your Z"
[HOW] - "Just [step], [step], done"
[CTA] - "Comment [keyword] and I'll send you the link"
```

**Duration:** 25-30 seconds (sweet spot)

## How to Write a Script

1. **Pick a hook formula**:
   - `"[Company] just [launched/dropped] [thing]"` → News
   - `"Stop [wasting X]"` → Problem/solution
   - `"This AI can [do X better than Y]"` → Comparison

2. **Add immediate value anchor:**
   - "and it's completely free"
   - "which companies charge thousands for"

3. **Use "just" liberally** — makes everything feel effortless:
   - "You just paste in your website"
   - "Just describe your topic"

4. **Cascade features** (groups of 3-5):
   - "your social media, your emails, your databases"

5. **End with exact CTA:**
   - "Comment [keyword] and I'll send you the link"
