## Troubleshooting

### Emotion Not Working?

**Check placement** - Must be at sentence start for English:
```
✅ (happy) This is correct!
❌ This is (happy) incorrect!
```

**Verify spelling** - Tags must match exactly:
```
✅ (happy)
❌ (happi)
❌ (Happy)
```

**Include parentheses**:
```
✅ (excited)
❌ excited
```

### Unnatural Sound?

- Space out emotional changes
- Use appropriate intensity
- Test with different voices
- Add context text after effects

### Testing Recommendations

1. Generate short samples (10-15 seconds)
2. Test emotions individually first
3. Try combinations on separate takes
4. Compare with neutral version
5. Adjust model if needed (s1 best for emotions)
