# UpgradeSkills

Upgraide's curated collection of Claude Code skills. Quality over quantity.

## Philosophy

- **Start small**: Add skills one by one, evaluate before committing
- **Best practices first**: Every skill follows Anthropic's guidelines
- **Tested**: Skills are validated with real usage before inclusion
